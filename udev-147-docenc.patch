+                <para>The name of a symlink targeting the node. Every matching rule adds
+		this value to the list of symlinks to be created.</para>
+		<para>The set of characters to name a symlink is limited. Allowed characters are 
+		[0-9A-Za-z#+-.:=@_/], valid utf8 character sequences, and "\x00" hex encoding.
+		All other characters are replaced by a _ character.</para>
+		<para>Multiple symlinks may be specified by separating the names by the space character. 
+		In case multiple devices claim the same name, the link always points to the device 
+		with the highest link_priority. If the current device goes away, the links are 
+		re-evaluated and the device with the next highest link_priority becomes the owner 
+		of the link. If no link_priority is specified, the order of the devices 
+		(and which one of them owns the link) is undefined.</para>
+		<para>Symlink names must never conflict with the kernels default device node names, 
+		as that would result in unpredictable behavior.
